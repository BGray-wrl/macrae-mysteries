                Dr. Macrae doesn&apos;t believe in unexplained deaths. Especially not when a thirty-year-old flatlines in his ER with no warning, no symptoms, and no obvious cause. Young, healthy, and dead. So he does what he always does—asks one too many questions. <br /> <br />
                Only this time, Macrae may not want the answers because some very unpleasant people have spent a fortune burying the truth.<br /><br />
                Digging into the case means stirring up things better left alone: shady science, bad money, and the kind of muscle that doesn&apos;t knock. <br /><br />
                People keep telling him to let it go. Macrae&apos;s never been great at that. But if he keeps poking around, someone&apos;s going to make sure he stops…for good.

                  &quot;When Macrae arrived for his shift that morning he had no idea he would pronounce someone dead. It wasn&apos;t uncommon in the ER. It happened, just not every day.

Only this one was different because thirty-year-olds didn&apos;t die in his ER unless they wrapped themselves around a telephone pole or found the bottle of Oxycontin.
